    Fasd (pronounced similar to "fast") is a command-line productivity 
    booster. Fasd offers quick access to files and directories for POSIX 
    shells. It is inspired by tools like autojump, z and v. Fasd keeps track 
    of files and directories you have accessed, so that you can quickly 
    reference them in the command line.
